/**
 * Topic: Java Program Structure
 * -----------------------------
 * Short Description:
 * A Java program typically consists of a class with a main method where execution starts.
 *
 * Real-Life Example:
 * You write your program logic inside the main method. This is similar to writing the 'main function' in C/C++.
